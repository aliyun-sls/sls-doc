# Query data by joining two Logstores

Join the current Logstore with internal-operation_log and query the number of page views (PVs). Limit the time of the two Logstores in the on condition and use the project name as the join condition.
The number of joined logs is displayed in a table.

```SQL
* |
select
  count(1) as count
from
  log l
  join internal - operation_log i on l.__date__ > '2020-04-01 00:00:00'
  and l.__date__ < '2020-04-08 00:00:00'
  and i.__date__ > '2020-04-01 00:00:00'
  and i.__date__ < '2020-04-08 00:00:00'
  and l.projectName = i.Project
```
