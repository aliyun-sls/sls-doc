# Query the keys and values from JSON data

Use the histogram function to obtain the request methods and the number of times that each method is used in the JSON format. Then, use the map_keys function to obtain all the keys and values from the JSON data.

```SQL
|
select
  histogram(request_method) as request_method,
  map_keys(histogram(request_method)) as request_method_key,
  map_values(histogram(request_method)) as request_method_value
```
