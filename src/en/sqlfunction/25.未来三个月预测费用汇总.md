Aggregate and calculate the total expense by day and sort the data by time. Find the current date and time, and use the sls_inner_ts_regression function to predict the next 90 points. Aggregate the predicted points and time by month, and then calculate the predicted monthly expense after the current date and time.
The results are displayed in a column chart, in which the x-axis represents the time and the y-axis represents the predicted expense.
