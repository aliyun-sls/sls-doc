# Calculate the sine, tangent, cosine, arccosine, arcsine, and arctangent values

Use the pi() function to obtain π and then use the sin function to obtain the value of sin(π/2), which is sin90°.
Use the pi() function to obtain π and then use the tan function to obtain the value of tan(π/6), which is tan30°.
Use the pi() function to obtain π and then use the cos function to obtain the value of cos(π/6), which is cos30°.
Use the pi() function to obtain π and then use the acos function to obtain the value of acos(π/4), which is acos45°.
Use the pi() function to obtain π and then use the asin function to obtain the value of asin(π/4), which is asin45°.
Use the pi() function to obtain π and then use the atan function to obtain the value of atan(π/4), which is atan45°.
