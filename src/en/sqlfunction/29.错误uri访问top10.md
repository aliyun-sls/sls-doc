Filter the data based on the return_code field. A status code greater than or equal to 400 indicates a request error. Aggregate the data based on the URI, obtain the number of errors for each URI, sort the URIs by the number of errors in descending order, and then obtain the top 10 URIs.
The results are displayed in a doughnut chart, which shows the total number of errors and the proportion of errors for each URI.

```SQL
return_code > 400 |
select
  uri,
  count(*) as c
group by
  uri
order by
  c desc
limit
  10
```
