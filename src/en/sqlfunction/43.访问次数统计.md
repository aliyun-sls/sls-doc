# Collect statistics on access counts

Round the second-level time to minute-level time based on **time** - **time** % 60.
Use the from_unixtime function to convert the value of the **time** field to a timestamp.
Use the date_format function to convert the time to the hour:minute format.
Use the group by clause to group the data by minute.
Use the count function to calculate the number of page views (PVs) per minute.
Use the approx_distinct function to calculate the number of accesses with a unique client IP address and use the value as unique visitors (UVs).
Use the order by clause to sort the data by minute.
The results are displayed in a line chart, in which the x-axis represents the date, the left y-axis represents the number of PVs, and the right y-axis represents the number of UVs.

```SQL

select
  date_format (from_unixtime(__time__ - __time__ % 60), '%H:%i') as date,
  count(*) as pv,
  approx_distinct(client_ip) as uv
group by
  __time__ - __time__ % 60
order by
  __time__ - __time__ % 60
```
