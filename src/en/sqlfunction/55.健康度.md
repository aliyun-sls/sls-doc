# Query the health status

Calculate the health status by dividing the number of records that meet the condition return_code < 500 by the total number of records.
Use the compare function to compare the value calculated for the current time with the value calculated for 86,400 seconds ago.
An array is returned, which contains the current value, the value 86,400 seconds ago, and the ratio of the first value to the second value in sequence.
The results are displayed in a single value chart, in which the \_col0 field indicates the display value and the \_col2 field indicates the comparison value.
