# Decompose time series data

**Keyword**

> nested subquery, time series analysis, time series decomposition

**correlation function**

> ts_decompose,avg

Aggregate the time by minute, calculate the average duration for responding to a request, and then use the ts_decompose function to decompose the results. The src field indicates the raw data, the trend field indicates the decomposed trend data, the season field indicates the decomposed period data, and the residual field indicates the decomposed residual data. These four fields are returned by the ts_decompose function, along with the unixtime field.
The results are displayed in a time series chart.

```SQL
* |
select
  ts_decompose(stamp, value, 1, 'avg')
from
  (
    select
      __time__ - __time__ % 60 as stamp,
      avg(body_bytes_sent) as value
    from
      log
    GROUP BY
      stamp
    order by
      stamp
  )
```
