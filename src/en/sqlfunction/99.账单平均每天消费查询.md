Use the date_trunc function to calculate the consumption of each day and then use the geometric_mean function to obtain the average daily consumption.
The result is displayed in a single value chart. In this example, the value is 4.816k.

```SQL

select
  geometric_mean(total) as "Average daily consumption (CNY)"
from
  (
    select
      date_trunc('day', __time__) as day,
      sum(PretaxAmount) as total
    from
      log
