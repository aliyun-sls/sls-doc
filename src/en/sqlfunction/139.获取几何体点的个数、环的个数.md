# Obtain the number of points and rings in a geometric entity

Use the ST_LineFromText function to construct a geometric entity and then use the ST_NumPoints function to obtain the number of points in the geometric entity.
Use the ST_GeometryFromText function to construct a geometric entity and then use the ST_NumInteriorRing function to obtain the number of rings in the geometric entity.

SELECT
  ST_NumPoints(
    ST_LineFromText('linestring (10 10 , 20 20 )')
