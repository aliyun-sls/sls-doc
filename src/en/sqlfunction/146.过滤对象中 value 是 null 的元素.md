# Filter out elements whose value is null

Use the map function to combine array1 and array2 into an object and use array1 as the object key and array2 as the object value. Then, use the map_filter function to filter out the elements whose value is null to obtain a new object.

```SQL
|
SELECT
  map_filter(
    MAP(ARRAY [10, 20, 30], ARRAY ['a', NULL, 'c']),
    (k, v) -> v IS NOT NULL
  ) as newObj
```
