# Convert a big-endian binary string into a number, convert a number to a big-endian binary string, and calculate the SHA256 hash value for a binary string

Use the to_big_endian_64 function to convert a number into a big-endian binary string. Use the from_big_endian_64 function to convert a big-endian binary string into a number. Use the from_base64 function to convert a number into a binary string. Use the sha256 function to calculate the SHA256 hash for a binary string.
