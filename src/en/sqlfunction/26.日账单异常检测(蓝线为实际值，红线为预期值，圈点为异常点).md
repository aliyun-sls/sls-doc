Aggregate the data by day to obtain the daily consumption amount, sort the data by time, find the latest time, and then use the ts_predicate_arma function to obtain the anomaly detection results.
The results are displayed in a time series chart.

```SQL
source :bill |
select
  ts_predicate_arma(day, total, 5, 1, 1, 1, 'avg')
from
  (
    select
      *
    from
      (
        select
          *,
          max(day) over() as lastday
        from
          (
            select
              to_unixtime(date_trunc('day', __time__)) as day,
              sum(PretaxAmount) as total
            from
              log
            group by
              day
            order by
              day
            limit
              1000
          )
      )
    where
      day < lastday
  )
```
