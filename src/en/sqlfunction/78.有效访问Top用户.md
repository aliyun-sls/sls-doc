# Query the top users with valid requests

To query the top users with valid requests, perform the following operations:
Aggregate and calculate the number of requests, the size of downloaded data, and the number of valid requests of each IP address based on the client_ip field. Sort the data based on the number of valid requests in descending order and obtain the top 100 records. Then, use the ip_to_country, ip_to_province, ip_to_city, and ip_to_provider functions to process deduplicated client IP addresses, and use the concat function to concatenate the results.
The results are displayed in a table, as shown in the following figure.

```SQL
* |
SELECT
  client_ip,
  CASE
    WHEN ip_to_country(client_ip) = 'Hong Kong' THEN concat('', ' ( Hong Kong )')
    WHEN ip_to_province(client_ip) = '' THEN concat('', ' ( Unknown IP )')
    WHEN ip_to_provider(client_ip) = 'Internal IP address' THEN concat('', ' (      Private IP )')
    ELSE concat(
      '',
      ' ( ',
      ip_to_country(client_ip),
      '/',
      ip_to_province(client_ip),
      '/',
      if(
        ip_to_city(client_ip) = '-1',
        'Unknown city',
        ip_to_city(client_ip)
      ),
      ' ',
      ip_to_provider(client_ip),
      ' )'
    )
  END AS "Source",
  pv as "Total number of requests",
  (pv - success_count) as "Number of error requests",
  throughput as "Total downloads (MB)"
from
  (
    select
      client_ip,
      count(*) as pv,
      round(sum(response_size) / 1024.0 / 1024, 2) AS throughput,
      sum(if(return_code < 400, 1, 0)) AS success_count
    from
      log
    group by
      client_ip
    order by
      success_count desc
    limit
      100
  )
```
