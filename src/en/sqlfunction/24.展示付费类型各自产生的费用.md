Aggregate and calculate the total expense based on the month and billing method, sort the data by time, and then use the case when clause to display the expenses based on the alias of the billing method.
The results are displayed in a column chart, in which the aggregated column represents the billing method, the x-axis represents the time, and the y-axis represents the expense.

```SQL
source :bill |
select
  date_format(day, '%Y-%m-%d') as day,
  total,case
    when Item = 'PayAsYouGoBill' then 'Pay-as-you-go'
    when item = 'SubscriptionOrder' then 'Subscription'
    when item = 'Refund' then 'Refund'
    when item = 'Adjustment' then 'Adjustment'
    else item
  end as "Billing method"
from(
    select
      date_trunc('month', __time__) as day,
      sum(PretaxAmount) as total,
      Item
    from
      log
    group by
      day,
      Item
    order by
      day
  )
limit
  10000
```
