Filter the data based on the return_code field. A status code greater than or equal to 400 indicates a request error. Aggregate and calculate the number of requests based on the user_agent field, sort the data based on the number of requests in descending order, and then obtain the top 10 records.
The results are displayed in a table.

```SQL
return_code > 400 |
select
  user_agent as "Client version",
  count(*) as "Errors"
group by
  user_agent
order by
  "Errors" desc
limit
  10
```
