# Convert between radians and angles and obtain the natural logarithm, logarithm base 2, 10, or a random number of a number

Use the pi() function to obtain Ï€ and then use the degrees function to convert radians into angles.
Use the radians function to convert angles into radians.
Use the ln function to obtain the natural logarithm of a number.
Use the log2 function to obtain the logarithm base 2 of a number.
Use the log10 function to obtain the logarithm base 10 of a number.
Use the log function to obtain the logarithm base of a random number.
