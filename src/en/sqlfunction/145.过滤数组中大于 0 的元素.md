# Filter out elements greater than 0 from an array

Use the date_trunc function to convert the value of the **time** field into time t in the hour format, aggregate the data by time t, and then use the filter function to filter elements greater than 0 in the array and use the results as Subquery 1. Query the results of Subquery 1 to obtain a new array composed of elements greater than 0. The results are displayed in separate columns.

```SQL
* |
select
  t,
  arr [1] as item1,
  arr [2] as item2,
  arr [3] as item3
FROM  (
    select
      filter(ARRAY [5, -6, 3, 7], x -> x > 0) as arr,
      date_trunc('minute', __time__) as t
    FROM      log
  )
```
