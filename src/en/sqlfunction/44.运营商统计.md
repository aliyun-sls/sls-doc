# Query ISP statistics

Use the ip_to_provider function to convert the client IP addresses to ISPs.
Use the sum function to calculate the sum of values of the response_size field as the download traffic.
Divide the sum of values of the response_size field by the sum of values of the request_time field to obtain the download speed.
Use the count function to calculate the number of occurrences.
Use the group by clause to group the data by ISP to obtain the network speed of each ISP.
Sort the data by download traffic and obtain the top 200 records.
The results are displayed in a table.

```SQL
* |
select
  ip_to_provider(client_ip) as isp,
  count(*) as "Access count",
  sum(response_size) / 1024.0 / 1024.0 / 1024.0 as "Download traffic (GB)",
  sum(response_size) * 1.0 / sum(request_time) as "Download speed (KB/s)"
group by
  isp
having
  ip_to_provider(client_ip) != ''
order by
  "Download traffic (GB)" desc
limit
  200
```
