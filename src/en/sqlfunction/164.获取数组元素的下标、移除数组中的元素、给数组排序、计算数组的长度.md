# Query the index of an element in an array, remove elements from an array, sort elements in an array, and calculate the length of an array

Use the array_position function to query the index of an element that first appears in an array. Use the array_remove function to remove elements from an array. Use the array_sort function to sort elements in an array. Use the cardinality function to calculate the length of an array.

```SQL
* |
SELECT
  array_position(ARRAY [1, 2, 3,3,4,5,2,3], 4) as "Query the index of an element that first appears in an array",
  array_remove(ARRAY [1,2,3,4,5], 3) as "Remove elements from an array",
  array_sort(ARRAY [1,2,3,4,5,2,2,4]) as "Sort elements in an array",
  cardinality(ARRAY [1,2,4,5,2,1]) as length
```
