# Query the traffic and network speeds of ISPs

Use the ip_to_provider function to convert the client IP addresses to ISPs.
Use the sum function to calculate the sum of values of the response_size field and the sum of values of the request_time field.
Divide the sum of values of the response_size field by the sum of values of the request_time field to obtain the download speed.
Use the count function to calculate the number of occurrences.
Use the group by clause to group the data by ISP to obtain the network speed of each ISP.
Sort the data by count and obtain the top 10 records.
The results are displayed in a line chart, in which the x-axis represents the ISP, the left y-axis represents the total download amount, the right y-axis represents the download speed in Kbit/s, and the column represents the total downloads.

```SQL
* |
select
  ip_to_provider(client_ip) as isp,
  sum(response_size) * 1.0 /(sum(request_time) + 1) as "Download speed (Kbit/s)",
  sum(response_size) as "Total downloads",
  count(*) as c
group by
  isp
having
  ip_to_provider(client_ip) != ''
order by
  c desc
limit
  10
```
