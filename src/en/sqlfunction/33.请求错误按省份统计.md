Filter the data based on the return_code field. A status code greater than or equal to 400 indicates a request error. Use the ip_to_province function to obtain the provinces where the clients reside, aggregate and calculate the number of requests from each province, sort the data by the number of requests in descending order, and then obtain the top 50 records.
The results are displayed on a map, which shows the number of request errors for each province.

```SQL
return_code > 400 |
select
  ip_to_province(client_ip) as province,
  count(*) as c
group by
  province
order by
  c desc
limit
  50
```
