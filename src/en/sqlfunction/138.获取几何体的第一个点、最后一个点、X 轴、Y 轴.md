# Obtain the first point, last point, x-coordinate, and y-coordinate of a geometric entity

Use the ST_LineFromText function to construct a line and then use the ST_StartPoint function to obtain the first point of the line.
Use the ST_LineFromText function to construct a line and then use the ST_EndPoint function to obtain the last point of the line.
Use the ST_Point function to construct a point and then use the ST_X function to obtain the x-coordinate of the point.
Use the ST_Point function to construct a point and then use the ST_Y function to obtain the y-coordinate of the point.
