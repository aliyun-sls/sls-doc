# Query the cache hit ratio

Calculate the cache hit ratio by dividing the number of hits based on the conditions return_code < 400 and hit_info = HIT by the total number of requests.
Use the compare function to compare the value calculated for the current time with the value calculated for 86,400 seconds ago.
An array is returned, which contains the current value, the value 86,400 seconds ago, and the ratio of the first value to the second value in sequence.
The results are displayed in a single value chart, in which the \_col0 field indicates the display value and the \_col2 field indicates the comparison value.

```SQL
return_code < 400 |
select
  diff [1],
  diff [2],
  round((diff [3] -1) * 100, 2)
from
  (
    select
      compare(Hit_ratio, 86400) as diff
    from
      (
        select
          sum(s) * 100.0 / count(*) as Hit_ratio
        from
          (
            select
              case
                when hit_info = 'HIT' then 1
                else 0
              end as s
            from
              log
          )
      )
