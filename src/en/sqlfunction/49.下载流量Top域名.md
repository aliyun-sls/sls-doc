# Query the top domain names by download traffic

Use the group by clause to group the data by domain name.
Use the sum function to calculate the traffic of each domain name.
Use the order by clause to sort the data by the total downloads. In this clause, the desc keyword indicates that the domain names are sorted by download traffic from large to small.
Use limit 100 to obtain the first 100 records. The results are displayed in a pie chart, in which the domain name is used for classification and the total downloads are displayed in the value column.

```SQL
* |
select
  Domain,
  sum(response_size) as "Total downloads"
group by
  Domain
order by
  "Total downloads" desc
limit
  100
```
