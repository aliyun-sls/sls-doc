Filter the data based on the return_code field. A status code greater than or equal to 400 indicates a request error. Aggregate and analyze the data based on the client_ip field to obtain the corresponding province, ISP, and number of error requests. Sort the data based on the number of error requests in descending order and obtain the top 100 IP addresses.
The results are displayed in a table.

```SQL
return_code >= 400 |
select
  client_ip,
  ip_to_province(client_ip) as "province",
  ip_to_provider(client_ip) as "ISP",
  count(*) as "Errors"
group by
  client_ip
order by
  "Errors" DESC
limit
  100
```
