# Query the top domain names by access count

Use the group by clause to group the data by domain name.
Use the count function to calculate the number of occurrences of each domain name.
Use the order by clause to sort the data by the number of occurrence. In this clause, the desc keyword indicates that the domain names are sorted by access count from large to small.
Use limit 100 to obtain the first 100 records. The results are displayed in a pie chart, in which the return_code field is used for classification and the c field is displayed in the value column.

```SQL
