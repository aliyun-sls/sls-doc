Filter the data based on the return_code field to collect statistics on status codes within the range of 400 to 500. Use the ip_to_province and ip_to_provider functions to obtain the provinces and ISPs based on the client IP addresses. Then, aggregate and calculate the number of requests based on the two conditions and calculate the error percentage.
The results are displayed in a table.

```SQL
return_code >= 400
and return_code < 500 |
select
  province as "Province",
  isp as "ISP",
  c as "Errors",
  round(c * 100.0 / sum(c) over(), 2) as "Error percentage(%)"
from
  (
    select
      ip_to_province(client_ip) as province,
      ip_to_provider(client_ip) as isp,
      count(*) as c
    from
      log
    group by
      province,
      isp
    having(ip_to_provider(client_ip)) != ''
    order by
      c desc
  )
```
