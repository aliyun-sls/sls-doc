# Query the PV trend and day-to-day comparison from NGINX access logs

Use the date_trunc function to convert the value of the **time** field into time t in the hour format, aggregate the data by time t, and then use the count function to calculate the number of page views (PVs) per minute and use the results as Subquery 1. Use the ts_compare function to query the results of Subquery 1 to obtain the arrays of PVs per minute and the ratio of PVs of today to PVs of yesterday and use the results as Subquery 2. Then, query the results of Subquery 2 to obtain the PVs of today and yesterday and the comparison ratio from the arrays. The results are displayed in separate columns.

  t,
  d [1] as today,

FROM  (
    SELECT
      t,
      ts_compare(pv, 86400) as d
    from(

          date_trunc('minute', __time__) as t,
          count(1) as pv
