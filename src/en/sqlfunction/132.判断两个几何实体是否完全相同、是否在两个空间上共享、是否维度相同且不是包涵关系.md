# Check whether two geometric entities are identical, intersecting with each other, or overlapping

Use the ST_GeometryFromText function to construct two geometric entities and then use the ST_Equals function to check whether they are identical.
Use the ST_GeometryFromText function to construct two geometric entities and then use the ST_Intersects function to check whether they are intersecting with each other.
Use the ST_GeometryFromText function to construct two geometric entities and then use the ST_Overlaps function to check whether they are overlapping.
