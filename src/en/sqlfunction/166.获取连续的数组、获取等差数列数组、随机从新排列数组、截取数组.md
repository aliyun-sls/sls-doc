# Obtain a continuous array, obtain an arithmetic progression array, randomly rearrange elements in an array, and slice an array

Use the sequence function to obtain a continuous array and an arithmetic progression array. Use the shuffle function to randomly rearrange elements in an array. Use the slice function to slice an array.

```SQL
|
SELECT
  sequence(0, 6) as "Obtain an array with continuous numbers from 0 to 6",
  sequence(0, 10, 2) as "Obtain an array with even numbers from 0 to 10",
  shuffle(ARRAY [1,2,3,4,56,5]) as "Randomly rearrange elements in an array",
  slice(ARRAY [1,2,4,5,6,7,7], 3, 2) as "newArr"
```
