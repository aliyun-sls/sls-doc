# Collect statistics on download traffic

Use the ip_to_country function to convert the client IP addresses to countries or regions.
Calculate the sum of values of the response_size field as the download traffic.
Divide the sum of values of the response_size field by the sum of the values of the request_time field to obtain the download speed.
Use the group by clause to group the data by country or region, and use the having clause to remove countries or regions that have not been resolved.
Sort the data by the download traffic and obtain the top 100 records. The results are displayed in a table.

```SQL
* |
select
  ip_to_country(client_ip) as "Country or region",
  count(*) as "Access count",
  round(sum(response_size) / 1024.0 / 1024.0 / 1024.0, 2) as "Download traffic (GB)",
  round(sum(response_size) * 1.0 / sum(request_time), 2) as "Download speed (Kbit/s)"
group by
  "Country or region"
having
  ip_to_country(client_ip) != ''
order by
  "Download traffic (GB)" desc
limit
  200
```
