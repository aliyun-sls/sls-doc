# Query projects with high write latency

Group the data by project, use the avg function to calculate the average latency, and then use the having clause to find the data with a latency of more than 5.7 seconds. Then, use the order by clause to sort the data in descending order.
The results are displayed in a table.

```SQL
method :PostLogstoreLogs |
select
  avg(latency) as avg_latency,
  projectName
group by
  projectName
HAVING
  avg_latency > 5700000
order by
  avg_latency desc
```
