# Calculate the inherent dimensions of a geometric entity, calculate the minimum distance between two geometric entities, and check whether a geometric entity is closed

Use the ST_GeometryFromText function to construct a geometric entity and then use the ST_Dimension function to calculate the inherent dimensions of the geometric entity.
Use the ST_GeometryFromText function to construct two geometric entities and then use the ST_Distance function to calculate the minimum distance between them.
Use the ST_LineFromText function to construct a geometric entity and then use the ST_IsClosed function to check whether the geometric entity is closed.
