# Collect statistics on status codes for POST requests

Use the numeric_histogram_u function to divide POST requests into seven groups based on the status code and collect the number of POST requests in each group.
The results are displayed in a column chart with multiple rows and multiple columns.

```SQL
request_method :post |
select
  numeric_histogram_u(7, status) as "POST requests of each status code"
```
