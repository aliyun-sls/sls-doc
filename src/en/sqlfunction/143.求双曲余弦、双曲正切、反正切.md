# Calculate the hyperbolic cosine, hyperbolic tangent, and arctangent values

Use the pi() function to obtain π and then use the cosh function to obtain the value of cosh(π/4), which is sin45°.
Use the pi() function to obtain π and then use the tanh function to obtain the value of tanh(π/6), which is tanh30°.
Use the pi() function to obtain π and then use the atan2 function to obtain the value of atan2(π,6), which is atan30°.

select
  cosh(pi() / 4) as "cosh90�",
  tanh(pi() / 6) as "tanh30�",
  atan2(pi(), 6) as "atan30�"
```
