Aggregate the data based on the time granularity of minutes and the return_code field, and use the count function to obtain the number of errors. Filter out data with the status code greater than 400 based on the condition return_code / 100 >= 4. Then, use the case when cause to group the data filtered out based on the status code 4xx and 5xx and display the number and percentage of errors with the two status codes.
The results are displayed in a flow chart, in which the x-axis represents the time, the y-axis represents the ratio, and the aggregated column represents the status code.

  date_format (from_unixtime(m_time), '%H:%i') as date,

    else '5xx'
