Filter the data based on the return_code field. A status code greater than or equal to 400 indicates a request error. Use the ip_to_provider function to obtain the ISPs based on the client IP address, and filter out the empty records, which are generated for client IP addresses that are not recorded in the IP address library. Aggregate and calculate the number of requests for each ISP, sort the ISPs based on the number of requests in descending order, and then obtain the top 10 ISPs.
The results are displayed in a doughnut chart, which shows the total number of requests and the number and percentage of requests from each ISP.

```SQL
return_code > 400 |
select
  ip_to_provider(client_ip) as isp,
  count(*) as c
group by
  isp
having
  ip_to_provider(client_ip) != ''
order by
  c desc
limit
  10
```
