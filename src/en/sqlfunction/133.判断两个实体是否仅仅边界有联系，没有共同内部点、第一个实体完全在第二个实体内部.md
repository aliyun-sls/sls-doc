# Check whether two geometric entities contact in the boundaries without common internal points and whether one geometric entity is completely included in the other

Use the ST_GeometryFromText function to construct two geometric entities and then use the ST_Touches function to check whether they contact in the boundaries without common internal points.
Use the ST_GeometryFromText function to construct two geometric entities and then use the ST_Within function to check whether one geometric entity is completely included in the other.
