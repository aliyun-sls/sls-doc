# Query access sources

Remove logs whose access sources are empty based on the filter conditions. Aggregate and calculate the number of requests from each access source and their percentage based on the refer_domain field, with two decimal places retained.
The results are displayed in a table.

```SQL
not refer_domain :"" |
select
  refer_domain as "Source",
  c as "Requests",
  round(c * 100.0 /(sum(c) over()), 2) as "Percentage (%)"
from
  (
    select
      refer_domain as refer_domain,
      count(*) as c
    from
      log
    group by
      refer_domain
    order by
      c desc
    limit
      100
  )
```
