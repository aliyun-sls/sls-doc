# Collect statistics on access counts

Use the ip_to_geo function to convert the IP addresses to countries or regions in the geo format.
Use the group by clause to group the data by country or region.
Use the count function to calculate the number of requests from each country or country.
Use the order by clause to sort the data by the number of occurrence. In this clause, the desc keyword indicates that the access counts are sorted from large to small.
Use limit 100 to obtain the first 100 records.
The results are displayed on a heatmap, in which the longitude and latitude represent the country or region and the count is displayed in the value column.

```SQL

select
  ip_to_geo(client_ip) as country,
  count(*) as count
group by
  country
order by
  count desc
limit

```
