Display the daily consumption of the current month and the predicted consumption for the remaining period, one point per day. Group the data based on the bill number to obtain the corresponding time, service identifier, bill type, and payable amount.Aggregate and calculate the daily expense, and then find the latest day on which the expense is incurred by time.Use the time, expense, passed string (which can be used as an alias later), prediction period, and number of prediction points as parameters in the sls_inner_ts_regression function to obtain the current daily consumption and subsequent prediction results.
The results are displayed in a line chart, in which the x-axis represents the time and the y-axis represents the real consumption and predicted consumption.
