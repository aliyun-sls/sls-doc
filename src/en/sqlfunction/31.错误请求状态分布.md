Filter the data based on the return_code field. A status code greater than or equal to 400 indicates a request error. Aggregate the data filtered out based on the status code to obtain the number of errors for each status code and sort the data based on the number of errors in descending order.
The results are displayed in a pie chart, which shows the number and percentage of errors for each status code.

```SQL
return_code >= 400 |
select
  return_code,
  count(*) as c
group by
  return_code
order by
  c desc
```
