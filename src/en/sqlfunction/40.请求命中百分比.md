# Query the request hit ratio

Filter the data based on the return_code < 400 condition.
Round the time to integer minutes based on **time** - **time** % 60.
If the condition hit_info = 'HIT' is met, set the count to 1 and identify the result as is_hit .
Combine the count query and the time as a subquery.
Use the from_unixtime function to convert the value of the **time** field to a timestamp.
Use the date_format function to convert the time to the hour:minute format.
Use the group by clause to group the data by minute.
Use the sum function to calculate the request hit ratio by dividing the value of the is_hit field by the total number of requests.
The results are displayed in a line chart, in which the x-axis represents the date field and the y-axis on the left represents the hit_ratio field.

```SQL
return_code < 400 |
select
  date_format (from_unixtime(m_time), '%H:%i') as date,
  sum(is_hit) * 100.0 / count(*) as hit_ratio
from
  (
    select
      __time__ - __time__ % 60 as m_time,
      case
        when hit_info = 'HIT' then 1
        else 0
      end as is_hit
    from
      log
  )
group by
  m_time
order by
  m_time
```
