# Collect statistics on request method types

Use the histogram function to obtain the request methods and the number of times that each method is used. Then, use the cardinality function to calculate the number of keys, which represents the number of request method types.

```SQL
|
select
  cardinality(histogram(request_method)) as "request_method的种类数",
  histogram(request_method) as request_method
```
