# Calculate the powers of a number, disable data type conversion, and obtain the infinite number

Use the pow(2,3) function to calculate the third power of 2.
Use the to_base(180,2) function to convert the number 180 to a binary number.
Use the infinity() function to obtain the positive infinity.

```SQL
|
SELECT
  pow(2, 3) as "Calculate the third power of 2",
  to_base(180, 2) as "Convert the number 180 to a binary number",
  infinity() as "Obtain the positive infinity"
```
