# Query the average download speed

Divide the sum of values of the response_size field by the sum of values of the request_time field to obtain the download speed.
Use the compare function to compare the value calculated for the current time with the value calculated for 86,400 seconds ago.
An array is returned, which contains the current value, the value 86,400 seconds ago, and the ratio of the first value to the second value in sequence.
The results are displayed in a single value chart, in which the \_col0 field indicates the display value and the \_col2 field indicates the comparison value.
