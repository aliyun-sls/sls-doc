Use the date_trunc function to align the dates by day, then calculate the total daily expenses through the aggregation of time and product names, sort by day, arrange by the daily expenses in descending order on the basis of time through the Window function, and finally take the product display names and prices with the top six prices, and classify the rest into others, and format and display the time and expenses.
Use flow chart to show that X-axis time, Y-axis cost and aggregation are listed as product names.
