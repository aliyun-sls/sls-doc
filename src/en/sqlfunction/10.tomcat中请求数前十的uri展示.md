Group the data based on the request_uri field and then use the count function to calculate the page views (PVs) of each request uniform resource identifier (URI). Sort the data based on the number of PVs in descending order and obtain the top 10 URIs. The results are displayed in a bar chart, in which the x-axis represents the number of PVs and the y-axis represents the request URI. The URI with most requests is displayed on the top.Aggregate the data based on the request_uri field and then use the count function to calculate the page views (PVs) of each request URI.
