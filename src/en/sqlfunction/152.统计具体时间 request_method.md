# Collect time statistics on request methods

Use the date_trunc function to convert the timestamps into the time format and then use the map_agg function to aggregate the data by using the time as the key and use the request_method field as the value. The results are displayed in the JSON format.

```SQL
|
select
  map_agg(date_trunc('minute', __time__), request_method) as request_method
```
