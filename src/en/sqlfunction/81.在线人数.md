# Query the number of online users

Use the approx_distinct function to obtain the number of unique visitors (UVs) based on the client_ip field, and then use the compare function to compare the value of today with that of yesterday.
The results are displayed in a day-to-day comparison chart, which shows the number of UVs of today and the change compared with that of yesterday.

```SQL
* |
select
  diff [1],
  diff [2],
  round(diff [3] -1, 4) * 100
from
  (
    select
      compare(uv, 86400) as diff
    from
      (
        select
          approx_distinct() as uv
        from
          log
      )
  )
```
