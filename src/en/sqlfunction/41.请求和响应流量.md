# Query the request and response traffic

Round the second-level time to minute-level time based on **time** - **time** % 60.
Use the from_unixtime function to convert the value of the **time** field to a timestamp.
Use the date_format function to convert the time to the hour:minute format.
Use the group by clause to group the data by minute.
Use the sum function to calculate the sum of values of the response_size field per minute.
Sort the data by integer minute.
The results are displayed in a line chart, in which the x-axis represents the date and the y-axis on the left represents the bandwidth in G/min.

```SQL
* |
select
  date_format (from_unixtime(__time__ - __time__ % 60), '%H:%i') as date,
  sum(response_size) / 8000000000.0 as "Bandwidth G/min"
group by
  __time__ - __time__ % 60
order by
  __time__ - __time__ % 60
```
