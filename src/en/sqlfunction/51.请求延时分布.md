# Query the distribution of request latencies

Use the case when a then b else c end clause to customize the result based on the return value.
In this clause, a is the condition for judgment and b is the returned result if one of the previous conditions is met.
c is the returned result if none of the previous conditions are met.
Use the group by clause to obtain the number of delayed requests in each range specified by the request_time field.
The results are displayed in a pie chart, in which the latency is used for classification and the count is displayed in the value column.

```SQL
* |
select
  case
    when request_time < 5000 then '~5s'
    when request_time < 6000 then '5s~6s'
    when request_time < 7000 then '6s~7s'
    when request_time < 8000 then '7~8s'
    when request_time < 10000 then '8~10s'
    when request_time < 15000 then '10~15s'
    else '15s~'
  end as latency,
  count(*) as count
group by
  latency
```
