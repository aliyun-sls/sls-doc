Aggregate the data based on the http_user_agent field, and query the number of the requests from each agent and the total traffic returned to clients. The traffic unit is byte. Convert the unit into MB and round the values to two decimal places. Then, use the case when clause to divide the data into several layers based on the value of the status field, which can be 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, and 5xx. Calculate the percentage of each layer.

select
  http_user_agent as "User agent",
  count(*) as pv,
  round(sum(request_length) / 1024.0 / 1024, 2) as "Request message traffic(MB)",
  round(sum(body_bytes_sent) / 1024.0 / 1024, 2) as "Traffic returned to clients(MB)",
  round(
    sum(
      case
        when status >= 200
        and status < 300 then 1
        else 0
      end
    ) * 100.0 / count(1),
