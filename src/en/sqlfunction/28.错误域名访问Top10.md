Filter the data based on the return_code field. A status code greater than or equal to 400 indicates a request error. Aggregate the data based on the domain name, obtain the number of errors for each domain name, sort the domain names by the number of errors in descending order, and then obtain the top 10 domain names.
The results are displayed in a doughnut chart, which shows the total number of errors and the proportion of errors for each domain name.

```SQL
return_code > 400 |
select
  domain,
  count(*) as c
group by
  domain
order by
  c desc
limit
  10
```
