# Download speed (Kbit/s)

Use the ip_to_country function to convert the client IP addresses to countries or regions.
Use the sum function to calculate the sum of values of the response_size field and the sum of values of the request_time field.
Divide the sum of values of the response_size field by the sum of values of the request_time field to obtain the download speed.
Use the count function to calculate the number of occurrences.
Use the group by clause to group the data by country or region to obtain the network speed of each country or region.
Sort the data by count and obtain the top 300 records.
The results are displayed on a world map, in which the speed is displayed in the value column.
