# Calculate the number of 1s in a binary string, reverse all bits in a binary string, and perform the OR and XOR operations on two numbers in binary form

Use the bit_count function to calculate the number of 1s in a binary string. Use the bitwie_not function to reverse all bits in a binary string. Use the bitwie_or function to perform the OR operation on two numbers in binary form. Use the bitwie_xor function to perform the XOR operation on two numbers in binary form.
