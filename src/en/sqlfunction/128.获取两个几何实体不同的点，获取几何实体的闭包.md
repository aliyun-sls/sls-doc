# Obtain different points between two geometric entities and obtain the boundary of a geometric entity

Use the ST_GeometryFromText function to construct geometric entities and then use the ST_Difference function to obtain different points between two geometric entities.
Use the ST_Point function to construct a geometric entity and then use the ST_Boundary function to obtain the boundary of the geometric entity.
