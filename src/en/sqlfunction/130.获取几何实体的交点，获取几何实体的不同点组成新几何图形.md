# Check whether two geometric entities are tangent to each other, have shared points, or are intersecting with each other

Use the ST_GeometryFromText function to construct two geometric entities and then use the ST_Contains function to check whether they are tangent to each other.
Use the ST_GeometryFromText function to construct two geometric entities and then use the ST_Crosses function to check whether they have shared points.
Use the ST_GeometryFromText function to construct two geometric entities and then use the ST_Disjoint function to check whether they are intersecting with each other.
