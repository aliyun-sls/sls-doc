## Benefits

- Easy-to-use: You can enable the application with a few clicks and use centralized storage for the application. The application provides built-in reports to meet different requirements, such as monitoring dashboards, troubleshooting, and the convergence and analysis of observable data.
- Large-scale: The application allows you to write and query ultra-large amounts of time series data based on the time series data storage engine of Simple Log Service.
- Real-time: The application supports a minimum collection interval of 5 seconds to provide real-time monitoring data in scenarios such as development and operations (DevOps), monitoring, and alerting.
- Scalable: You can filter metrics or specify a custom retention period for each metric.The storage capacity of a Metricstore can be dynamically scaled to meet business requirements.
- Intelligent: The application can detect and identify errors in an efficient and accurate manner because it uses the stream inspection algorithm that is developed by Alibaba DAMO Academy for artificial intelligence for IT operations (AIOps).

## Core values

- The Full-stack Monitoring application is based on Simple Log Service capabilities, such as collection, storage, analysis, visualization, alerting, and AIOps.
