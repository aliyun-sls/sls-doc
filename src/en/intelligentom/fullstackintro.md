## Benefits
- Easy-to-use: You can enable the application with a few clicks and use centralized storage for the application. The application provides built-in reports to meet different requirements, such as monitoring dashboards, troubleshooting, and the convergence and analysis of observable data.
- Full-stack: The application supports various types of IT systems and observable data. It allows you to collect metric data, log data, and trace data in multiple programming languages.
- Automatic: The application supports the automatic installation of Logtail on Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instances and in Kubernetes clusters. The application can automatically generate service topologies and network topologies.
- Large-scale: The application allows you to write and query ultra-large amounts of observable data based on the observable data storage and analysis engine of Simple Log Service.
- Scalable: You can filter all types of observable data or specify a custom retention period for the data.The storage capacity of a Logstore or Metricstore can be dynamically scaled to meet business requirements.
- Intelligent: The application can detect and identify errors in an efficient manner because it uses the stream inspection algorithm that is developed by Alibaba DAMO Academy for artificial intelligence for IT operations (AIOps).


## Core values
- The Full-stack Observability application provides all-in-one, out-of-the-box features to support the convergence and association analysis of logs, traces, and metrics. This enables the end-to-end observability of IT systems.
