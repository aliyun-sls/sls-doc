Calculate the total expense of yesterday, use the coalesce function to return 0 if no expense is generated, use the round function to retain three decimal places, and then use the compare function to calculate the month-to-month comparison ratio. The results are displayed in a month-to-month comparison chart, which shows the total consumption of yesterday and the comparison to the same day in the last month.

```sql
source :bill |
select
  round(diff [1], 2),
  round(diff [2], 2),
  round(diff [3] * 100 -100, 2)
from(
    select
      compare("Consumption yesterday", 604800) as diff
    from(
        select
          round(coalesce(sum(PretaxAmount), 0), 3) as "Consumption yesterday"
        from
          log
      )
  )
```
