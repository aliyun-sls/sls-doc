### Limit the range of a histogram and the number of bars

To limit the range of a histogram and the number of bars, go to the **General Configurations** tab and click **Histogram Settings**.

**Limit the range of a histogram:** Configure the **Starting Position** and **End Position** parameters to determine the range of a histogram.

**Limit the number of bars:** After the range of a histogram is determined, configure the **Coordinate Scale** parameter. The number of bars is calculated by dividing the range of a histogram by the value of the **Coordinate Scale** parameter.

The following figure shows the configurations.
