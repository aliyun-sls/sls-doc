# Topology layouts
## Layouts
- Hierarchical layout

In the hierarchical layout, nodes in the topology are categorized and arranged based on node levels. This way, relationships and connections between nodes become clearer.

- Force-directed layout

Force-directed layout is a network diagram layout based on physical models. Nodes and edges in the topology are arranged on a plane by simulating the effect of force fields in physics. Each node is a particle with energy, and each edge simulates the force between particles. This way, the distance between nodes becomes more appropriate, and the length of edges becomes shorter. This achieves better visualization effect.

- Circular layout

Nodes are arranged on a ring as much as possible. In most cases, this is suitable for scenarios where the number of nodes is small and relationships between nodes are complex.

##  Configuration
### Temporary layout
Switch the temporary layout, as shown in the following figure. The generated layout is not saved.

### Default layout
On the **General Configurations** tab, click **Layout Configuration**. In the **Layout Configuration** section, set the **Layout Type** parameter to **Force-directed Layout**, **Hierarchical Layout**, or **Circular Layout**.
