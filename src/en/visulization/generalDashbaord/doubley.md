# Create a line chart with multiple y-axes

If you want to display different types of data or different scales of data in a line chart (Pro), you can add multiple y-axes to the line chart. This topic describes how to create a line chart with multiple y-axes.

## Causes why a single y-axis is added

When two or more lines need to be drawn in a line chart (Pro), the lines share the same y-axis or have multiple y-axes. The following factors work together to determine whether a single y-axis is generated by specifying a field.

1. y-axis ID

2. y-axis direction

## Create a line chart with multiple y-axes for a query statement

In this example, the number of requests that are sent from the China (Shanghai) region per minute and the number of requests that are sent from the China (Hangzhou) region per minute are displayed in a line chart.

1. In the upper-right corner of the dashboard page, click **Edit**.
2. In edit mode, click **Add** and then click **Add Chart**. On the **General Configurations** tab, click the **Line Chart Pro** icon in the **Chart Types** section.
3. Configure the parameters on the **Search & Analysis** tab and click **Apply**.。
   Add the following query statement. For more information, see [Query and analysis](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/doc-detail/339860.htm?spm=a2c4g.11186623.0.0.56145b29B9NO9c#concept-2134122)。

   ```sql
   * | select __time__ - __time__ % 60 as time, count_if(region='cn-shanghai') AS count1, count_if(region='cn-hangzhou') AS count2 GROUP BY time order by time
   ```

 In the **Query and Analysis Configurations** section of the **General Configurations** tab, set the **Axis Y Field** parameter to **count1** and **count2**. After you configure the parameters, the line chart displays the number of requests that are sent from the China (Shanghai) region and the number of requests that are sent from the China (Hangzhou) region and the trends of the requests. The blue line indicates the trend of requests that are sent from the China (Shanghai) region, and the green line indicates the trend of requests that are sent from the China (Hangzhou) region.

4. Configure the parameters on the **Field Configuration** tab.
   On the **Field Configuration** tab, add a y-axis for the **count1** column. For more information, see [Configurations on the Fields tab](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/doc-detail/340721.htm?spm=a2c4g.11186623.0.0.56145b29B9NO9c#section-f59-ql8-mzd)。

   After you configure the parameters, the line chart displays two y-axes that have different scales. The left y-axis indicates the number of requests that are sent from the China (Hangzhou) region, and the right y-axis indicates the number of requests that are sent from the China (Shanghai) region.

## Create a line chart with multiple y-axes for two query statements

In this example, the number of successful requests per minute and the number of failed requests per minute are displayed in a line chart.

1. In the upper-right corner of the dashboard page, click **Edit**.
2. In edit mode, click **Add** and then click **Add Chart**. On the **General Configurations** tab, click the **Line Chart Pro** icon in the **Chart Types** section.
3. Configure the parameters on the **Search & Analysis** tab and click **Apply**.
   - Query Statement A: counts the number of successful requests per minute.

   ```sql
   status in [200 299] | SELECT __time__-__time__ % 60 AS Time, count(1) AS OK GROUP BY Time ORDER BY Time LIMIT 1000
   ```

   - Query Statement B: counts the number of failed requests per minute.

   ```sql
   NOT status in [200 299] | SELECT __time__-__time__ % 60 AS Time, count(1) AS ERROR, status GROUP BY Time, status ORDER BY Time LIMIT 1000
   ```

   The system displays the results of the two query statements in a line chart. You can view the trends of successful and failed requests. The blue line indicates the trend of successful requests, and the green line indicates the trend of failed requests.
   The following figure shows that the numbers of successful and failed requests significantly differ. As a result, the trend of failed requests is not obvious because the two trends share the same y-axis. In this case, you can configure the parameters on the **Field Configuration** tab to add a second y-axis to the right of the line chart. The second y-axis indicates the number of failed requests.

## Create a line chart with multiple y-axes for three query statements

In this example, the numbers of requests by request duration within a minute are displayed in a line chart.

1. In the upper-right corner of the dashboard page, click **Edit**.
2. In edit mode, click **Add** and then click **Add Chart**. On the **General Configurations** tab, click the **Line Chart Pro** icon in the **Chart Types** section. 
3. Configure the parameters on the **Search & Analysis** tab and click **Apply**.

   - Query Statement A: counts the number of requests whose duration ranges from 10 to 50 seconds.

   ```sql
   request_time in [10 50) | SELECT __time__-__time__ % 60 AS Time, count(1) AS count1, request_time GROUP BY Time, request_time ORDER BY Time LIMIT 1000
   ```

   - Query Statement B: counts the number of requests whose duration ranges from 50 to 100 seconds.

   ```sql
   request_time in [50 100) | SELECT __time__-__time__ % 60 AS Time, count(1) AS count2, request_time GROUP BY Time, request_time ORDER BY Time LIMIT 1000
   ```

   - Query Statement C: counts the number of requests whose duration is longer than 100 seconds.

   ```sql
   request_time >= 100 | SELECT __time__-__time__ % 60 AS Time, count(1) AS count3, request_time GROUP BY Time, request_time ORDER BY Time LIMIT 1000
   ```

   ![picture 9](/img/src/visulization/doubley/9a2d3c4bfd5a74a5d297e195c629297987ad0cf8cb91b05571702b4d0d02e765.png)

   The system displays the results of the three query statements in a line chart. You can view the trends of requests by request duration. The blue line indicates the trend of requests whose duration ranges from 10 to 50 seconds, the green line indicates the trend of requests whose duration ranges from 50 to 100 seconds, and the yellow line indicates the trend of requests whose duration is longer than 100 seconds.
   The following figure shows that the numbers of requests by request duration significantly differ. As a result, the trends of count2 and count3 are not obvious because the three trends share the same y-axis. In this case, you can configure the parameters on the **Field Configuration** tab to add two y-axes to the right of the line chart. 

   ![picture 10](/img/src/visulization/doubley/89d2ecde777375f950fd7adf2d78c0645c9bdd74bcb876f25076405c83b20026.png)

4. Configure the parameters on the **Field Configuration** tab.
   On the **Field Configuration** tab, configure the parameters to add two y-axes. For more information, see [Configurations on the Fields tab](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/doc-detail/340721.htm?spm=a2c4g.11186623.0.0.56145b29B9NO9c#section-f59-ql8-mzd)。

   - Add a y-axis for the results of Query Statement B.
   - Add a y-axis for the results of Query Statement C.

   > Note: If you add two or more y-axes on the same side, you must configure an ID for each y-axis. Different IDs can be used to add different y-axes. The ID of a y-axis is an arbitrary string.

   After you configure the parameters, the line chart displays three y-axes that have different scales. The three y-axes indicate the numbers of requests by request duration.
