If metric data is collected at a high sampling rate, you can perform downsampling to reduce the sampling rate.You can perform downsampling to reduce the volume of data that you want to query and extend the data retention period. This way, the query speed can be increased and most trends and characteristics of raw data can be retained.Simple Log Service provides the downsampling feature to group and aggregate the data points in a time series based on a specific algorithm.For more information about the configuration, see the following figures.
