By default, the Prometheus Query compute engine does not cache query results. Each time you query data, all data is computed. This is inefficient in scenarios in which the data volume is large and the query time range is long.The global cache feature supports reuse of specific results for the same query. If the PromQL statement and the step parameter that you specify for a query are the same as the settings that you specify for a previous query, the two queries are considered the same, and the results of the previous query can be reused. The feature reuses the query results within the same query time range and separately queries data that is beyond the time range.For more information about the configuration, see the following figures.
